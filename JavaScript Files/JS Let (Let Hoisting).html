    <h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>

<p>With <b>var</b>, you can use a variable before it is declared:</p>

    <p id="d1"></p>
    <script>
        carName = "Volvo";
        var carName;
        document.getElementById("d1").innerHTML = carName;
    </script>

<!--
Let Hoisting
Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.

Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared:

Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

Meaning: Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError:
carName = "Saab";
let carName = "Volvo"; -> GIVES ERROR!!!

<!--
The script Tag
In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.

Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute: <script type="text/javascript">.
The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML.

JavaScript Functions and Events
A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.

For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.

JavaScript in <head> or <body>
You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.

Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.

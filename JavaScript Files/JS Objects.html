<script>
    let car = "Fiat";
    document.getElementById("p1").innerHTML = car;
</script>

<p id="p2"></p>

<h2>Accessing Object Properties</h2>

<p>You can use person.property or person["property"].</p>


<p id="p4"></p>
<script>
    const person2 = {
        fname:"Jack",
        lname:"Jones",
        id: 11223
    };
    document.getElementById("p4").innerHTML = person2.fname + " " + person2.lname + " " + person2.id;

<!--
JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties.
-->

<!--
In the example above, this refers to the person object.

I.E. this.firstName means the firstName property of this.

I.E. this.firstName means the firstName property of person.

What is this?
In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.

Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).

The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:

In an object method, this refers to the object.
Alone, this refers to the global object.
In a function, this refers to the global object.
In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.
Note
this is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this.

The this Keyword
In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.

In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.

In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.

JavaScript Dollar Sign $
Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers 
containing $ are valid variable names:

Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional 
programmers often use it as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library.

In the JavaScript library jQuery, for instance, the main function $ is used to select
HTML elements. In jQuery $("p"); means "select all p elements".

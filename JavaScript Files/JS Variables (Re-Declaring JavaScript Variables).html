Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables
If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.

The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:

Note
You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.

This will not work:

let carName = "Volvo";
let carName;
